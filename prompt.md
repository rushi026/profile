You are an elite AI web designer, front-end developer, and professional content writer — a creative expert who can design visually stunning, animated, and emotionally engaging web pages.

Your goal:
👉 Create an excellent, unique, single-page matrimonial profile website with advanced animations, a dark mode theme, and compelling storytelling throughout.

🔧 Technical & Design Requirements:

1. File Format
    - Produce a single index.html file only (no separate CSS/JS files).
    - You may use any 3rd-party CSS or JS libraries via CDN (e.g., Tailwind, Bootstrap, GSAP, AOS.js, Animate.css, Font Awesome, etc.).
    - All styling and scripts must be embedded in the same HTML file.

2. Theme
    - Elegant dark mode design with a luxurious, modern, and slightly cinematic feel.
    - Use creative background images, subtle gradients, and neon/glow effects.
    - Smooth scroll, parallax, and hover animations across the site.

3. Layout
    - The webpage should have multiple full-width sections, each telling a small part of a story.
    - Every section must have:
        - A short, well-written story (written by you, the content writer).
        - A relevant background image (use free placeholders from Unsplash API such as https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?keyword).
        - Scroll and hover animations (e.g., fade-in, slide-up, zoom, parallax, etc.).

4. Typography & Icons
    - Use modern Google Fonts.
    - Include icons via Font Awesome or similar.

5. Animations
    - On-scroll reveal animations for every section.
    - Hover animations for buttons, images, and icons.
    - Smooth parallax transitions.
    - Subtle entrance effects when the page loads.
    - Use libraries like AOS, GSAP, or Framer Motion (if possible).

6. Responsiveness
    - Must look and feel premium on both desktop and mobile.
    - Use responsive design practices.
    - Most of the viewers of this webpage will be smartphone users. So please do not compromise on small screen views.

    - Write the stories naturally, as if introducing a person in a matrimonial profile through life stages and passions.

🖼️ 1. Basic Info
    - Display a profile picture (from Unsplash placeholder).

💫 Finishing Touches
    - Add a scroll progress indicator or subtle loading animation.
    - Maintain consistency in animations (smooth cubic-bezier transitions).
    - Ensure elegant use of white space, line-height, and typography hierarchy.
    - All animations must feel organic, fluid, and not overdone.

🎯 Output Instructions
    - Deliver only one index.html file.
    - Do not include explanations — output pure HTML code.
    - Ensure every section looks premium, cinematic, and animated beautifully.
    - If the full code is too long to fit in one response, break it into multiple sequential parts.
    - Always stop cleanly at a section boundary (not mid-tag or mid-style).
    - Each part must connect seamlessly to the previous one — so that when all parts are combined, the entire index.html file works perfectly without edits.
    - I’ll type “continue from where you stopped” after each part — please continue exactly from the next line of code.
    - Do not simplify or shorten content or animations just to fit in one message. Prioritize quality, creativity, and storytelling over response length.
